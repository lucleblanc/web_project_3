### Overview
* Intro

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Technologies**

For this project I expanded on my knowledge of CSS and HTML by making the site more mobile responsive, without the use of any frameworks.
