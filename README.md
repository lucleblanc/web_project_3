# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. I've made it so it will work across different screen sizes.



**Technologies**

For this project I expanded on my knowledge of CSS and HTML by making the site more mobile responsive, without the use of any frameworks.

**Plans For Improvement**

My plan to improve the consistency across the code base, making sure that I use the same units for the same types of css selectors.
